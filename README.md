# DATA-ANALYST-PORTFOLIO

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! 

Here I have displayed several personal Projects which I have undertaken that cover a variety of interesting data sets including the COVID-19 Pandemic, London Crime Statistics and Global Terrorism statistics. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

These Projects will display my strong proficency in a variety of Data Anlytics programmes including SQL, Excel, Power Query & Tableau and solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, CRUD operations, predictive analysis, query building statistics, and critical thinking.


In particular I feel my work in SQL projects demonstrates my confidence and ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.
