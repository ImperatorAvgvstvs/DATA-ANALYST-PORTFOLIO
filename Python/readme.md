## **Data Visualisation of The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**

### **Summary**
This Project attempts to answer, with an array of simple and complex data visualisations a variety of question on key statistics from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open-source database recording information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 to 2017 (except 1993). The GTD includes systematic data on domestic and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.

Throughout the project I make use of a variety of libararies including Pandas, Cufflinks and Plotly Express within a Jupyter Notebook

### **Data Source**
The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. The Global Terrorism Database is funded through START, by the US Department of State (Contract Number: SAQMMA12M1292) and the US Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorateâ€™s Office of University Programs (Award Number 2012-ST-061-CS0001, CSTAB 3.1). The coding decisions and classifications contained in the database are determined independently by START researchers and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official views or policies of the United States Government.
