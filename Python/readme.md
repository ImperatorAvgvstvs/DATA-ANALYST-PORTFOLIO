# Python Projects

Welcome to the Python Section of my Portfolio!

## **Data Visualisation of The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**

### **Summary**
This Project attempts to answer, with an array of simple and complex data visualisations a variety of question on key statistics from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open-source database recording information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 to 2017 (except 1993). The GTD includes systematic data on domestic and international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.

Throughout the project I make use of a variety of libararies including Pandas, Cufflinks and Plotly Express within a Jupyter Notebook

## **Machine Learning Model - Logistic Regression Analysis of Salifort Motors Employee Satisfaction**

### **Summary**
This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition for Salifort Motors, a large consulting firm. The aim is to provide data-driven insights to the Human Resources (HR) department to help them identify employees who may leave the company.

By leveraging machine learning and statistical analysis, this project delivers insights that can assist in retention strategies and workforce planning.

This was my capstone project for the Googel Advanced Data Analytics Certificate
