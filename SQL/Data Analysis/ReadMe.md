## Questions

Here I conducted an analysis of the data set in two pats, a brief initial view of the data on a global scale, which led to me to find that the UK was very high on the list of countries with the most attacks.
This lead me to conduct a further deep dive analysis of UK based statistics accross the full time scale, and subesequently an analysis on a more recent time scale. 

The following insights were gleaned from an analysis of the data set:

- The 10 most dangerous days by fatalities 1970-2017
- The top 10 countries with the most terrorist attacks 1970-2017
- Total Number of Attempted or Successful Terrorist Attacks in the UK 1970-2017
- How many attacks have occured each year in the UK 1970-2017
- Most Prominent Terrorist Groups in the UK 1970-2017
- Total Fatalities vs Injured in UK per year 1970-2017
- Top 10 cities in the UK with the most terrorist attacks 1970-2017
- In the last 20 years how many attacks have there been in Londonderry, Belfast and London each year, provide a rolling count for each year
- Frequency of Attack Types comittied in the UK across the last 20 years
- Which types of attacks produce the highest death count in the UK in the last 20 years
- Frequency of Target Types in the uk the last 20 years
- Highest and Lowest Fatalities by Target Types in the UK in the last 20 years
